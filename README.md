Tips and tricks for the game


First things first. It's a survival shooting game so you have to shoot the meteors and destroy them so you can survive. 
BE careful they will not be only meteors on the game!!!! 
In addition to that, they will be 3-4 stages with different enemies some of them will be shooting too. 
The goal is to reach 5000 score so you can fight the BOSS. 
More features to the game are: Healing, losing hp and more. Shielding will be coming soon.
